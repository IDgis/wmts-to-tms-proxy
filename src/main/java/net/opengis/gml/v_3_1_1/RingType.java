/**
 * A Ring is used to represent a single connected component of a surface boundary. It consists of a sequence of curves connected in a cycle (an object whose boundary is empty).
 * A Ring is structurally similar to a composite curve in that the endPoint of each curve in the sequence is the startPoint of the next curve in the Sequence. Since the sequence is circular, there is no exception to this rule. Each ring, like all boundaries, is a cycle and each ring is simple.
 * NOTE: Even though each Ring is simple, the boundary need not be simple. The easiest case of this is where one of the interior rings of a surface is tangent to its exterior ring.
